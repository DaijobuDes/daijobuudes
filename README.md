A simple discord python bot.
Plugins are easy to write, loadable, unloadable and reloadable for realtime plugin testing.


## Running the bot
Make sure you have python 3.5 or later to run this bot.

To install dependencies on python, type `pip3 install discord` or `python3 -m pip install discord`

To run, simply open a terminal in linux or command prompt in Windows then type `python3 main.py`. Also works in Android phones using Termux with dependencies installed.



## Bot Token
Simply get it from here https://discord.com/developers/applications/

Create a `token.txt` inside the directory with your discord bot token.
This is to separate the bot token for privacy purposes.
