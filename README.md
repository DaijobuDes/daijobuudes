A simple discord python bot

## Requirements
Core prerequisties, `discord`, `discord.py` and automatic dependencies.
For audio core, `PyNaCl`, `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg` must be installed.

`# apt update && apt install ffmpeg`

`$ python3 -m pip install discord discord.py PyNaCl youtube-dl`

## Running the bot
Simply open a terminal in linux or command prompt in Windows then type `python3 main.py`.
Also works in Android phones using Termux with dependencies installed.


## Bot Token
Simply get it from here https://discord.com/developers/applications/

Create a `token.txt` inside the directory with your discord bot token.
This is to separate the bot token for privacy purposes.
